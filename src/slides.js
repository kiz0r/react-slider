    title: 'The first photo',
    description:
      'The first photograph taken by the camera dates from 1826 (less commonly 1827). The image taken by Joseph Nisefor Niepce, known as the "View from the Le Gras" window, was created by a camera obscura on a disc covered with a thin layer of bitumen. Bitumen on different parts of the plate was frozen depending on the amount of light on it, then the undeveloped bitumen washed off. Nyeps called this technology heliography "solar writing".',

    title: 'The first human photo',
    description:
      'The first human photograph was taken by Louis Daguerre in 1838. Daguerre shot a view of the lively street of Paris, Boulevard du Tample; the exposure was almost 10 minutes, so that passers-by could not be captured in the photo - they simply did not stay in one place long enough to remain in the picture. However, in the lower left corner, there is a man standing there who is being shined. Later analysis of the image revealed that other people were on it - can you find them?',
